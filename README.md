# DeepLearning
This Python program builds a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch using NumPy to classify Iris flower species. It includes data preprocessing, normalization, and one-hot encoding, followed by manual implementation of forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent. The model consists of three layers with sigmoid and softmax activations. It is trained using mini-batch gradient descent with early stopping to prevent overfitting. The script evaluates model accuracy, generates a confusion matrix and classification report, and visualizes decision boundaries using PCA for dimensionality reduction. The code demonstrates core neural network principles without relying on deep learning frameworks.
